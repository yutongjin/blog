Both the first- and second-level leaders were laid off on the same day.
The team suddenly lost its sense of direction, moving like a group of headless flies.

The external market offers little comfort.
Every round of layoffs pushes another wave of strong candidates into the job pool.
Hundreds of people compete for a single role, and even getting a call from HR now feels like a stroke of luck.

Effort, in this environment, feels quiet.
But quiet does not mean optional.

When I’m exhausted, I force myself to think further ahead.
I think about my wife, and the children we haven’t yet met.
I think about the large house I still haven’t bought.
I think about a version of myself who knew he wasn’t enough, yet chose to push forward anyway.
And I think about my high-school self—once experimenting with sleeping at 12:45 a.m. and waking up at 5.

Back then, he had no fallback.
Neither do I now.

I’m writing this not to complain,
but to remind myself:
in an era where uncertainty is the norm,
the only thing still within my control is to keep moving forward.

Keep going.
